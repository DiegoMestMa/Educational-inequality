# Educational-inequality
This repository presents the estimation of educational inequality under the methodology of Thomas, Wang & Fan (2001), applied to different birth cohorts in Peru. The data were obtained from the ENAHO household survey.  

Note: the Do File "Unión de Módulos ENAHO y creación de variables - 2004-2021.do" must be executed in the first instance.
Note: the results have not been validated. Any suggestions for improvement can be sent to me at dffjs98@gmail.com.
